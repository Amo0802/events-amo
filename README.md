# NeoEvents Frontend

Hi! ðŸ˜Š This is the frontend for my full-stack events app, NeoEvents. I originally built it to help people in my local area find and create events nearby â€” since there wasnâ€™t anything like it around here. The app lets users browse upcoming local events, save ones theyâ€™re interested in, and get notifications.

I planned to publish and market it properly, but due to lack of time and motivation, itâ€™s now mainly a portfolio project showcasing what I can do.

## What It Does

- Users can browse events, filter by city or category, and search. 
- Users can submit event requests. To avoid spam, these are just requests â€” sent to me by email.
- I (or anyone I give admin access) review these requests and create official events.
- Admin users get extra UI buttons that regular users donâ€™t see, like creating or editing events.
- If a user isnâ€™t logged in and tries to access some features, they get redirected to the login page.
- Itâ€™s an MVP but has solid features and could easily go live as is.
  
### Note:  
Instead of local city names, the city filter uses an enum of European countries (like Spain, France, Germany) to make it more familiar for anyone reviewing my portfolio.

## Admin UI Overview

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2645.jpg"><br>
      <em>Home screen â€“ admin user has a button on the top right that normal users don't</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2646.jpg"><br>
      <em>Top-right button lets admin user assign admin roles to other users</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2647.jpg"><br>
      <em>Different menu when admin user clicks on + button</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2648.jpg"><br>
      <em>Create event UI - with this Admin can create an event, while normal user can only request event creating</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2649.jpg"><br>
      <em>Edit Event UI</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2650.jpg"><br>
      <em>Edit Event UI when ID is entered</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="IMG_2651.jpg"><br>
      <em>Delete Event UI</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



Admins can create, update, delete events, and assign admin permissions to other users. These options appear only after logging in with admin credentials.
If you'd like to test admin features, send me an email for credentials â€” I can't publish them here, because I don't want someone deleting my data.
